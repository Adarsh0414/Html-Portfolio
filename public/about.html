<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, Myself Adarsh !! <br/><p></p>I'm currently pursuing my BTech in Computer Science & Engineering at VIT Bhopal, working towards my goal of becoming a software engineer. I enjoy coding and problem-solving, and I'm always looking to learn new technologies that can help me grow.
  Life has thrown its challenges my way, but I’ve learned that resilience and determination can push me through anything. That’s what keeps me motivated to improve every day.
  Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my coding skills, working on projects, and connecting with people who share the same enthusiasm for tech. 
  If you’re into software development or just want to exchange ideas, let’s connect!</p>
