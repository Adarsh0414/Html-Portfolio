<h1>The Best Movies According to Adarsh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>It's honestly my all-time favorite anime — not just because of the story, but the vibe it gives.<br/>
    It’s about this girl, Chihiro, who accidentally ends up in this super weird and magical world full of spirits and creatures. Her parents turn into pigs (I know, sounds wild 😂), and she has to work in a bathhouse for spirits while figuring out how to save them and get back home.<br/>
    But the best part? The visuals are insane. Like, every frame looks like a painting — the colors, the atmosphere, everything feels so dreamy. And the music? Pure chills, bro. It’s so peaceful and emotional.<br/>
    It’s not just about magic and spirits though — the movie actually hits deep. It’s about growing up, being brave even when you're scared, and finding yourself.<br/><p></p>
    Trust me, even if you’re not into anime, this one hits different.

<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>It’s about this young programmer who gets invited by this billionaire CEO guy to his private, high-tech house in the middle of nowhere. The guy’s working on this super advanced AI robot named Ava — and the programmer’s job is to test if she’s truly conscious or just faking it. <br/>
    But dude… it’s not just a robot movie. It really messes with your head. Like, the whole time you’re wondering who’s playing who. The story gets super intense — quiet, creepy, and smart. And Ava? She’s not just a machine — she feels real, and it’s honestly kind of scary.<br/>
    The cinematography is clean and minimal, and the vibe is so futuristic but eerie at the same time. It makes you think about AI, humanity, and trust in ways you never expected.<br/><p></p>
    One of those movies that sticks with you after the credits roll.</p>
<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>It’s about this super quiet guy — he’s a stunt driver in Hollywood by day, and at night he’s a getaway driver. He barely talks, but his presence is just intense. Ryan Gosling absolutely nailed that role.<br/>
    But what really makes Drive special isn’t just the action (though the car chases are epic), it’s the style. The way it’s shot, the colors, the lighting — it feels like an 80s neon dream. And the soundtrack? Bro, it’s PERFECT. I still listen to “Nightcall” and “A Real Hero” — they hit so hard.<br/>
    It’s not your typical action movie — it’s slow, artistic, emotional, and suddenly brutal when it needs to be. Super unique vibe. Honestly, it’s more about mood and atmosphere than just story.<br/><p></p>
    It’s one of those films that just feels cool from start to finish.</p>
