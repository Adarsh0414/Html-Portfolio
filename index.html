    <h3><a href="./public/favouritemovieproject.html">Movie Ranking Project</a></h3>
    <p>This is a simple HTML webpage I designed while learning the basics of web development. It’s a simple movie-ranking page titled ‘The Best Movies According to Adarsh’ where I’ve listed my top 3 favorite movies of all time.
        <ul>
        <li>I used the <  h1 > tag for the main title to make it bold and attention-grabbing.</li>
        <li>Below that, an < h2 > heading introduces the list: 'My top 3 movies of all time.</li>
        <li>Then I added a horizontal line (< hr >) for separation and cleaner design.</li>
        <li>Each movie is listed using < h3 > tags for the movie titles (like Spirited Away, Ex Machina, and Drive), followed by a short description using < p > tags.</li>
    </ul>
        This project helped me practice semantic HTML structure, and I focused on organizing content clearly using proper heading levels and paragraph tags. My goal was to keep the layout neat and readable while expressing my personal taste in movies."

    <h3><a href="./public/Birthdayinvitationproject.html">Birthday Invite Project</a></h3>
    <P>This is another HTML webpage I created as part of my web development practice. It's a birthday invitation template. The page uses basic HTML elements such as headings, images, lists, and hyperlinks to present the information clearly.
        <ul>
        <li>At the top, I used an < h1 > tag for the main title — 'It's My Birthday!' — followed by an < h2 > for the invitation date and message.</li>
        <li>I included a colorful birthday cake image using the <img> tag to make the page visually attractive.</li>
        <li>Under that, I added a list (< ul >) of things to bring, like balloons, cake, an appetite, and a gift — formatted using bullet points for clarity.</li>
        <li>At the bottom, there's a section titled 'This is where you need to go:' which includes a clickable Google Maps link using the <a> tag.</li>
        </ul>
        This project helped me practice proper HTML structure, text formatting, image insertion, and hyperlinking. I aimed to keep it both fun and informative, simulating a real-world event invite.</P>
